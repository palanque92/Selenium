<h1> Re: Eileen Dover university application  </h1><br> <br>
Dear Eileen, <br> <br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year I
<br>
will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <br> <br>
Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020, 1 Oct 2020 <br> <br>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
<br>
beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows: <br> <br>
<ul>
  <li> First semester : 9 September 2016 </li>
  <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017 </li>
  <li> Third semester: 2 May 2017 </li>
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br> <br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
